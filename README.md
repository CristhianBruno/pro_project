## Introduction

### Problem

Like many other developing countries, our country, Bolivia, has a
flourishing startup industry with attractive growth potential and
adequate prospectives not only to fulfill the investors' financial
return requirements but the social and environmental returns as well.
Therefore, from a Triple Bottom Line perspective, a potential investment
in one of these markets could be a crucial step further on sustainable
portfolio construction.

However, one of the main shortcomings of these developing markets is the
lack of adequate tools and networks to raise the required resources and
connect the investors with prospective investees.

### Objective

The project aims to provide investors with a comprehensive platform for
the startup ecosystem. Furthermore, be one step ahead by showing the
essential features when analyzing a potential investment in this kind of
company. This way, we expect to address the market's shortcomings and
help its development.

On the other hand, we are facing times of uncertainty that force the
different market agents to provide out-of-the-box solutions. So, the
adaptability and replicability of these solutions is a paramount feature
to generate a real change in the matter.

### Methodology

As master students at UNIL MSc. in Finance program, we have faced this
issue on a two-part project consisting of a Prediction model and
Investors' Platform.

#### Prediction Model

The first part is carried out under the scope of the Advanced Data
Analytics class. This project first aims to understand the features that
have the most significant influence on the success of startups. Then,
using these features construct a classification model that can predict
the potential outcome of a startup given its set of features. This way,
we can provide the market with a more in-depth insight into the early
stage of a startup. Therefore, investors can focus their resources more
intelligently, and the entrepreneurs can redirect their efforts to
reinforce these features.

#### Investors' Platform

The second part of the project is carried out under the scope of the
Programming class. This project aims to develop a Graphic User Interface
(GUI) (from now on referred as platform) that displays the industry's
most relevant facts and allows the investor to search for specific
information by sub-industry to make a more informed investment decision.
Furthermore, we included in the platform the prediction model, developed
in the first part of the project, to enable investors and entrepreneurs
to interact with the model and improve their prospectives.

## Installation

### Get the Git repository

Our project is host in the following
[repository](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/README.md).
The steps required to clone the repository are the following:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. Copy the repository's URL.
4. According to your operative system:
   * For Windows: Open Git Bash.
   * For Mac/Linux: Open Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want
   the cloned directory.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. `$ git
   clone 'HERE-COMES-THE-URL'`

7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

### Setting the environment

The program requires the installation of the environment
pro_project_env, set on the following file pro_project_env.yml. The
environment's file is already included in the Github repository.

#### Conda and PIP environment installation

To create and activate the environment using the `pro_project_env.yml`
file follow this steps:

Conda:
1. Create the environment: `conda env create â€”-file pro_project_env.yml`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate pro_project_env`

PIP:
1. Create virtual environment: `virtualenv pro_project_env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `pro_project\Scripts\activate`

However, it can be executed on any environment that has installed the
following packages:
- Tkinter - version 8.6.8 (already included in Python)
- Numpy - version 1.18.1
- Pandas - version 1.0.3
- Matplotlib - version 3.1.3
- Scikit-Learn - version 0.23.0
- Pillow - version 7.1.2
- Pandastable - version 0.12.2

The program runs in Python - version 3.8.2.

## Pre-processing

The program is based on the CAX_startup data base uploaded by Ajay
Gorkar to Kaggle. To obtain this data we used the website's API and
worked it through our pre-processing process. In the next section we
will explain how to get the API and run the pre-processing algorithm.

### Kaggle API

To use the Kaggle API please follow these steps:
1. Sign up or sign in for a Kaggle account at
   [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. Go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile
   `https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account` and select 'Create API
   Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file
   containing your API credentials.
3. Place the downloaded file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.
4. Install the Kaggle package with `pip install kaggle` to run the
   pre-processing algorithm.

This process will let you to obtain the database directly from Kaggle,
which is the main input for this project.

### Pre-processing algorithm

Pre-processing the database is an essential step for the structuration
of both the model and platform. Throughout this process, we have first
analyzed the data and then proceed to uniformized each feature to clean
misspelled words or out-of-range values, always considering the
variable's nature.

All this work was implemented through a pre-processing algorithm written
in the Jupyter Notebook named `Preprocessing_PROG.ipynb`. To run this
script, please verify the adequate installation of the Kaggle API. Also,
the algorithm requires the installation of the Pandas library (already
included in the environment `pro_project_env.yml`).

The process first downloads the database using the API in a CSV file.
The database was uploaded by Ajay Gorkar in November 2019, and it is
currently available on Kaggle under a dataset called 'Startup Analysis'
which contains the file named 'CAX_Startup_Data.csv'. You can review the
repository [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaygorkar/startup-analysis).

The raw database consists of 472 entries, each representing a different
startup with 116 features for each one. After downloading the database,
the program will uniformize the empty entries and then delete all
non-useful features. The next step is to correct typo mistakes, capital
missuses, space problems, redefine industry categories, and rename all
the headers for a uniform presentation, to provide finally with a clean
output called `CAX_Preprocessed_PROG.csv`. This processed database
comprises 472 startups with 102 features, which is the primary input for
the platform construction.

## Implementation

Finally, to start the program, you need to run the main python file
called: `PRO_Final_Project_VMB.py` placed on the root directory of the
repository. This script runs the primary structure of the platform that
will be explained below. To run this script appropriately, we rely on
the following internal dependencies, hosted in the folder
`VMB_Generators/` present also on the repository. The dependencies and
their functions are:
1. `Button_Generator.py`: designed to generate all the buttons that
   connect every frame of the platform.
2. `Graph_Generator.py`: designed to create all the graphs.
3. `Industry_Selection.py`: designed to ease the selection of
   sub-industry and economic activity for the VMB Model.
4. `KeyFacts_Sector_Generator.py`: designed to display the key facts of
   each sector on the platform.
5. `Model_Generator.py`: designed run the prediction algorithm of the
   VMB Model.
6. `Pivot_Table_Generator.py`: designed to generate all the tables.

Each dependency host the required functions to structure the platform
and the widgets needed for the GUI. It is paramount to maintain the
folder structure as it was intended to keep the platform running. Please
keep this issue in mind.

## Structure

The user interface has the following structure:

1. Main page: Platforms main window.
2. Dashboard: Relevant information of the data base displayed as graphs
   and tables.
3. Analysis per sector: Relevant information of the industries in the
   data base.
4. VMB Model: Prediction model of the success of a startup based on the
   algorithm we generated through the Advanced Data Analytics project.

The links provided in each section displays the screenshots of each
frame in the program.

The platform's structure flow chart is presented below:

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Platform%20Flow%20Chart.jpg alt="VMB - Flow Chart" width=600 height=900>

### Main page

Platform's main window. It displays the most relevant facts from the
database and the options to move around the program. This
[section](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Main%20page.png)
consists of one frame which shows six labels for the database's
principal figures and the respective buttons for each section on the
platform.

### Dashboard

This
[section](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Dashboard.png)
represents a summary of the most relevant information of the database
displayed in two ways:
1. Statistics
   - [Table](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Dashboard-Statistics.png)
2. Graphs
   - [Page 1](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Dashboard-Graphs1.png)
   - [Page 2](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Dashboard-Graphs2.png)

The facts displayed in both the table and charts rely on the key
features found in the VMB's model development. Thus, they intend to show
the database distribution in terms of the characteristics that could
lead to a startup to be or not successful.

### Analysis per sector

This analysis's objective is to provide insight into the nine different
sectors of the economy where these startups work. The analysis per
industry is structured as follows:
1. [Frame 1](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Analysis%20per%20sector-Main.png):
   This frame contains a plot pie with the classification of the
   database on a sector basis.

2. [Frame 2](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Analysis%20per%20sector-Selector.png):
   This screen includes:
   1. An horizontal bar plot with the average amount of funding received
      by successful and failed startups in each sector.
   2. Option to select a specific sector to analyze. Each sector's
      frames displays its
      [profile](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Information%20Technology-Profile.png)
      and
      [statistics](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Information%20Technology-Statistics.png).

**IMPORTANT:** When using the platform, it is required to push the
'SUBMIT' button every time the user decides to change the selected
sector. If the new selection is not submitted, the program will direct
to the last selected sector's profile.

### VMB Model

VMB Model section displays the feature selection, and the prediction
made using our classification model. This section is structured in four
frames, three for the feature selection and one to present the results:
1. Features:
   [Industry](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Model-Features1.png).
   This section includes the following variables:
   - GSE - Sector
   - GSU - Sub-industry
   - IND - Economic activity
2. Features:
   [Experience of the team](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Model-Features2.png).
   This section includes the following variables:
   - AYE - Average relevant experience of cofounders
   - BIG - Cofounders have worked on one of the Big 5 consulting firms
   - REC - Number of recognitions to cofounders
   - SUR - Survival through recession periods of cofounders' previous
     startups
   - INC - Investment received through global incubator competitions
3. Features:
   [Market Characteristics and Busines Model](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Model-Features3.png).
   This section includes the following variables:
   - BAR - Existence of barriers of entry to the industry
   - DWF - Difficulty of obtaining workforce
   - PST - Existence of a pricing strategy
   - CPB - The service or product based on a platform or cloud
   - CDA - Focus on consumer data
   - MLB - Machine learning base
4. [VMB Model Results](https://github.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/blob/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Model-Results.png).
   This section prints the inputs submitted by the user and finally
   returns the model's prediction and precision.

**IMPORTANT:** When using the platform, it is required to push the
'SUBMIT' and 'CHARGE INPUT' buttons every time the user decides to
change the inputs selected. If the new selection is not submitted, the
program will upload the last submitted information to the prediction
model.

The characteristics of all the variables used on the model are presented
on the following
[document](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/pdf?commit=f5502b42dde7a7653d3a42c75ecbb0551a4cfd37&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f43726973746869616e4272756e6f2f70726f5f70726f6a6563742f663535303262343264646537613736353364336134326337356563626230353531613463666433372f4578747261732f466561747572652532304578706c616e6174696f6e732e706466&nwo=CristhianBruno%2Fpro_project&path=Extras%2FFeature+Explanations.pdf&repository_id=264005100&repository_type=Repository#bc595f58-5861-4b32-b4cd-7207682ccf7a).

Finally, to contact the selected startups please push the 'Contact the
startup(s)' button. This displays a
[message box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CristhianBruno/pro_project/master/Extras/VMB%20-%20Contact.png)
with the instructions to receive the contact information and more
in-depth data about the startups. This button is present at the end of
the VMB Model results and in every sector profile.

## Maintenance and update

Our team believes that through the correct implementation of these
developments, among other tools, it is possible to pursue the startup
ecosystem improvement in countries like ours (Bolivia). So, proper
maintenance and update of this codebase are paramount for the
development of a solution to these shortcomings.

The codebase for both parts of the project is updated in their
respective Github public repositories, which will allow us to keep the
projects' code stored adequately for further advances and share these
findings with other interested developers. All the code is appropriately
commented and documented to ease its use by an outside party.

As the project will take place in a region not covered by the initial
database scope, the adaptability, and replicability of this work is
essential for our intentions. Firstly, it is necessary to gather the
relevant information in the aimed markets. Once these databases are
uploaded, the model and platform must be adequately updated to reflect
this data, adjusting the prediction models, their respective parameters,
and the investors' platform to provide a better service for the
prospective niche (a platform in Spanish, for example).
